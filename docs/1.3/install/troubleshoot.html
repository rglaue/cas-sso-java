TroubleShooting

Testing the Blackboard 8 CAS SSO Auth module in stages (taken from The Powerlinks developers network FAQ)

How do I know whether an authentication module is properly deployed?

1. Does the module show up in institution-level administration, under the "System Integration" Column?

2. Has the deployable component been enabled on the institutional-level administration?

3. Has the "Master Switch" for deployable components been enabled (also in server-level administration, under the "Deployable Components" settings group)

4. Has the Default SSO Institution been specified?

5. Can you hit your deployable component from a browser, by going to the URL

http://<vista_host_and_port>/webct/urw/ss<url_pattern>.si<ims_id>.sn<ims_name>

? (Note: the authentication attempt will probably fail, but you should see in the log whether or not the request is reaching your AuthModule)
